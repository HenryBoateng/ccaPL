The Calculus of Context-aware Ambients (CCA) is a process calculus for modelling the behaviour of mobile and context-aware systems. A process calculus is a formalism for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronisations between a collection of independent processes. The main features of CCA are: mobility, context-awareness, and concurrency.

This website essentially allows developers to enhance their understanding of contextual aware languages via learning CCA. It comprises of the basics as well as has the environment for developers to code using the CCA online IDE with examples to follow along.
